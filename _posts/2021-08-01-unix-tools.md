Unix command line tools are fascinating to me always. I love the simplicty and power of the tools that help us to do text processing and to see the resource usage in the OS - be it disk, memory or CPU. The fact that we can pipe the output of one command to the other is powerful to the extent that we can do large data anlaysis with command line tools itself. 

One of the design principles from Unix is <i>"Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features"</i>. For example, if we look at the <i>uniq</i> command it does one thing well - take a sorted input and remove the duplicates from the input. This can be useful when we combine with the <i>sort</i> command.
