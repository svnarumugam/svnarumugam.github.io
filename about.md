Thanks for clicking here! My name is Saravanan. I am a son, husband, father who happens to appreciate
a few things including computer science, literature, music. I practice software engineering for my living. Isn't it amazing to see how software systems work? The fact that you are able to see this page sitting from a far off place in itself is a wonder! As much as I appreciate software systems, I do love literature and music. They have been my good friends all along the way.
