Thanks for clicking here! My name is Saravanan. I am a son, husband, father who happens to appreciate
computer science, music, literature a lot. I am a software engineer and an ardent fan of computer systems.
At times I wonder as if I had been seen a 1000 story building when I study systems. That is true to an extent. 
We can't see software but when we get to study software we realize how beautiful it is.
