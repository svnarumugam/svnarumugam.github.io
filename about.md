I am a son, husband, father who happens to appreciate
a few things including computer science, literature, music. I practice software engineering for my living. Isn't it amazing to see how software applications are intertwined in our life? The fact that you are able to see this page sitting from a far off place is a wonder in itself!

The chance to study computer science is one of the best things happened in my life. The influence of software systems is something I admire a lot - be it in agriculture, finance, healthcare, education, entertainment and many more :) Using softwares and appreciating is one side of the coin, and participating in the development of software is the other side of the coin. It's like the difference between the person who eats and the person who cooks. A cook knows what it takes to make a good dosa. When we see softwares from a cook's perspective, we see the beauty and the complexity better. I am fortunate that I get that perspective from my work.

As much as I love and respect software engineering, I love literature too. Falling in love with good words is a blessing. We can draw inspiration from them whenever we want. If you spend time with me, you would find me taking reference from "Thirukkural" often. One should read this book to appreciate the depth, beauty, and brevity. We wonder about millions of transistors being present in a small chip in our hand. I get the same wonder, excitement, mixed with reverence when I read couplets in Thirukkural. I have been making humble attempts to learn a little bit everyday. I have a long way to go!

If we think about one of things that will make us time travel, it's music. When you listen to a song or music, some times you feel you are transported back to that time. Has it ever happened to you? It happens to me often. The songs in Tamil movies were my first exposure to music. Tavil and Nadhaswaram were the first two instruments I got to see in temples and festivals. If you are curious, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ukWDK1RqgI) is a beautiful piece I recommend listening! I hold a special place for the people who play these instruments :)
