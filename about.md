Thanks for clicking here! My name is Saravanan. I am a son, husband, father who happens to appreciate
a few things including computer science, literature, music. I practice software engineering for my living. Isn't it amazing to see how software systems work? The fact that you are able to see this page sitting from a far off place is a wonder in itself!
